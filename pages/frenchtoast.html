<h2>Description</h2>
<p><em>Brioche and challah bread make the best French toast.
   <br> 
   Both are already so eggy that once dipped in the batter 
   and griddled in butter they become custard-like on 
   the inside. The nicely browned and caramelized outside 
   is thanks in part to the added sugar in the egg mixture. 
   <br>And playing with the flavor is easy: This recipe has a 
   touch of warmth from cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. 
   <br>
   <br>
   <strong>Here’s a pro tip: </strong> Make sure you don’t over-soak the bread. 
   <br>Fully submerge it in the batter for only a few seconds and let 
   any excess drip off before cooking. 
   <br>And wait for the bubbles from the melted butter to subside 
   — that’s when you know your pan is hot enough.</em></p>
