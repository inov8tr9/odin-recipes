<h1>Creating a lasagne recipe on this page called "lasagne".</h1>
<img src = "./las_bol.webp">

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne 
    from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce.</p> <a href = "https://www.bo.camcom.gov.it/it/about-us/chamber-commerce-bologna">It's here</a>
     <p>I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people 
        from the area, such as which meat and wine to 
        use or if there should be milk added or not. </p>
        
     <p>One thing never in question, though, is the 
        green lasagne sheets. These are a must.</p>
         
    <p>The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without 
        garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta 
        keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</b>
   
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <h3>Ragu:</h3>
        <ul>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</ul>
        <ul>½ cup diced carrot</ul>
        <ul>½ cup diced celery</ul>
        <ul>½ cup diced yellow onion</ul>
        <ul>½ cup diced yellow onion</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
        <ul>7 ounces ground beef</ul>
        <ul>6 ounces ground pork</ul>
        <ul>½ cup dry red wine</ul>
        <ul>1½ cups plain tomato sauce</ul>
        <ul>2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed</ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        
        
        <ol>Step 1:</ol>
        <p>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high 
           heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, 
           celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables 
           have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. 
           Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into 
           small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</p>

        <ol>Step 2:</ol>
           <p>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. 
           Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. 
           Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to 
           allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, 
           stirring occasionally.</p>

        <ol>Step 3:</ol>
        <p>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. 
           Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 
           hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; 
           ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</p>  

        <ol>Step 4:</ol>
        <p>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been 
           cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt 
           to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach 
           and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir 
           gently and cook until spinach is heated through. 
           Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</p>  

        <ol>Step 5:</ol>
        <p>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, 
           pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as 
           much water and possible; reserve the liquid. 
           Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</p>   
           
        <ol>Step 6:</ol>
        <p>Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the 
           center; add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon 
           of the reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or 
           using the dough hook of a stand mixer, adding more 
           liquid if needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth 
           ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room 
           temperature for 30 minutes.</p>

           <ol>Step 7:</ol>
           <p>Taste the ragu and adjust salt. Remove from 
              heat and add milk; stir well and set aside to cool.</p>
   
           <ol>Step 8:</ol>
              <p>Divide pasta dough into 4 equal sections. 
                 Use a pasta machine, or rolling pin, dusted 
                 with flour, to roll pasta into 1/16-inch thick 
                 sheets. Lay sheets on clean dish towels to 
                 help them dry. Let rest for 20 minutes.

            </p>
   
           <ol>Step 9:</ol>
           <p>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over 
              medium heat. Do not allow it to brown or burn. Add flour and whisk constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, whisking constantly. Repeat with remaining milk. Simmer until bechamel is thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with nutmeg and salt.</p>  
   
           <ol>Step 10:</ol>
           <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
              (175 degrees C).</p>  
   
           <ol>Step 11:</ol>
           <p>Spread a bit of the ragu sauce over the 
              base of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer 
              of pasta. Top with a spoonful of sauce and bechamel. 
              Add a spoonful of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top 
              with another layer of pasta. Add more sauce, bechamel, 
              and cheese. Repeat layers until you reach the top; 
              finish with a layer of pasta, bechamel, and cheese.</p>   
              
           <ol>Step 12:</ol>
           <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is 
              bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 
              to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes 
              at room temperature before slicing.</p>
